== Terms and definitions

The terms and definitions given in the above references apply to the GeoSPARQL specification, with the exception of the terms defined below.

**coordinate system**:  A set of mathematical rules for specifying how coordinates are to be assigned to points.

**coordinate reference system**: A **__coordinate system__** that is related to an object by a  **__datum__**.

**datum:** Parameter or set of parameters that define the position of the origin, the scale, and the orientation of a **__coordinate system__**.

**spatial reference system**:  A system for establishing spatial positions. A spatial reference system can use geographic identifiers (e.g. names like "Paris" or "Africa"), coordinates (in which case it is a **__coordinate reference system__**) or identifiers with structured geometry (in which case it is a Discrete Global Grid System (DGGS)).
