== Future Work

Many future extensions of this standard are possible and, since the release of GeoSPARQL 1.0, many extensions have been made. 

The GeoSPARQL 1.1 release tried to incorporate many additions requested of the GeoSPARQL 1.0 Standard, including options the use of other serializations of geometry data (e.g. KML, GeoJSON, DGGS) and the addition of handling spatial scalar measurements. 

Plans for future GeoSPARQL releases have been mooted but won't be articulated here, instead they will be discussed and decided apon by the OGC GeoSPARQL Standards Working Group and related groups. Readers of this document are encouraged to see out those groups' lists of issues and standards change requests rather than looking for ideas here that will surely age badly.
