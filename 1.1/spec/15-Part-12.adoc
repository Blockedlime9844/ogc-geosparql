== Future Work

Many future extensions of this standard are possible and, since the release of GeoSPARQL 1.0, many extensions have been made. The GeoSPARQL 1.1 release tried to incorporate many additions requested of the GeoSPARQL 1.0 Standard, including options the use of other serializations of geometry data (e.g. KML, GeoJSON, DGGS) and the addition of handling spatial scalar measurements. 

Significant work remains in developing vocabularies for spatial data, and expanding the GeoSPARQL vocabularies with OWL axioms to aid in logical spatial reasoning would be a valuable contribution. There are also large amounts of existing feature data represented either in a GML file (or similar serialization) or in a datastore supporting the general feature model. It would be beneficial to develop standard processes for converting (or virtually converting and exposing) this data as RDF.
