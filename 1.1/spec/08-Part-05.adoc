==== Placeholder IRIs

The IRI `ogc:geomLiteral` is used in requirement specifications as a placeholder for the geometry literal serialization used in a fully-qualified conformance class, e.g. `+<http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#wktLiteral>+`.
The IRI `ogc:asGeomLiteral` is used in requirement specifications as a placeholder for the geometry literal serialization property used in a fully-qualified conformance class, e.g. `geo:asWKT`.

==== RDF Serializations

Two RDF serializations are used in this document. Terse RDF Triple Language (turtle) [10] is used for RDF snippets placed within the main body of the document, and RDF/XML [11] is used for the examples in Annex B.
