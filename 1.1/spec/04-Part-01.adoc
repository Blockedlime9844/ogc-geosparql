=== Scope
This document defines GeoSPARQL: a spatial extension to the SPARQL query language for geographic information. GeoSPARQL provides the following features:

- An RDF/OWL vocabulary for representing spatial information consistent with the Simple Features model
- A set of SPARQL extension functions for spatial computations
- A set of RIF rules for query transformation

GeoSPARQL does not define a comprehensive vocabulary for representing spatial information. It instead defines a core set of classes, properties and datatypes that can be used to construct query patterns. Many useful extensions to this vocabulary are possible, and we intend for the GIS community to develop additional vocabulary for describing spatial information. Other standards groups are actively working to develop such a vocabulary (e.g. ISO/TC 211).
